A few years ago a colleague (SW tester) had a bright idea... to create a database with a web front end to manage all our test results.
The was a great time saver as it freed us up from making test reports to do more interesting work. 
It also kept our managers off our backs as they could check the results themselves online.
This idea expanded over the years into a feature that was essential to the daily working life.
Regression trending, test coverage and failures could be seen in an instant. 

Unfortunately the company sold off its divisions to other companies and a number of us left and went to work for different divisions.
We couldn't take the newest code with us (ethically) so we ended up with older versions which we then improved (forking) but were never able to merge back.

Switching jobs again revealed that another division needed a test result management system.
After a few times of reinventing the wheel I have decided to start with a clean sheet, design it better, make it open source then everyone can profit from it.
